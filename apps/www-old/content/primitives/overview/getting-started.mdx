## Implementing a Popover

In this quick tutorial, we will install and style the [Popover](../components/popover) component.

### 1. Install the primitive

Install the component from your command line.


<LiveProvider>
    <LiveEditor code={`npm install @raystack/apsara@latest`} border language="bash"/>
</LiveProvider>


### 2. Import the parts

Import and structure the parts.


<LiveProvider>
    <LiveEditor code={`
import * as React from 'react';
import { Popover, PopoverTrigger, PopoverContent } from '@raystack/apsara';

const PopoverDemo = () => (
  <Popover>
    <PopoverTrigger>More info</PopoverTrigger>
      <PopoverContent>
        Some more info…
      </PopoverContent>
  </Popover>
);

export default PopoverDemo;
    `} border />
</LiveProvider>


### 3. Add your styles

Add styles where desired.

<LiveProvider>
    <LiveEditor code={`
import * as React from 'react';
import * as Popover from '@radix-ui/react-popover';

const PopoverDemo = () => (
  <Popover>
    <PopoverTrigger>More info</PopoverTrigger>
      <PopoverContent>
        Some more info…
      </PopoverContent>
  </Popover>
);

export default PopoverDemo;
    `} border />
</LiveProvider>




## Summary

The steps above outline briefly what's involved in using a Radix Primitive in your application.

These components are low-level enough to give you control over how you want to wrap them. You're free to introduce your own high-level API to better suit the needs of your team and product.

In a few simple steps, we've implemented a fully accessible Popover component, without having to worry about many of its complexities.

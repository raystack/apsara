## Usage
The Badge component renders its children as its text content. 
It is advised to avoid placing complex content directly within the Badge and instead use it in conjunction with other components to compose the desired visual representation.
The Badge is primarily intended for highlighting information, indicating status, or drawing attention to specific elements within a user interface.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

<LiveProvider>
    <LiveEditor code={`npm install @raystack/apsara`} border/>
</LiveProvider>


## Anatomy

<LiveProvider>
    <LiveEditor code={`
import { Badge } from '@raystack/apsara'
    
<Badge>Badge</Badge>
`} border />
</LiveProvider>

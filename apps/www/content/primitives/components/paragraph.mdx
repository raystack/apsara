  <Paragraph size="2">This is a Paragraph size 2. Design in the target medium. Prototype with real
    components. Handoff production code.</Paragraph>
  <Paragraph size="1">This is a Paragraph size 1. A really long paragraph of text, to demonstrate prose
    text, like for example, the kind you might read in a blog post. The reason we're
    using prose here is because the most common use case for this container size is
    longform text. So we're previewing some longform text here so we can make sure the
    container width provides an optimal line length for this font size.</Paragraph>

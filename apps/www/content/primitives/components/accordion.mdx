          The other main improvement is with tables, which we'll probably use a lot. With
          horizontal overflow on small devices and when zoomed in, tables are a pain to
          navigate. I added a focus wrapper that will announce the table context to the
          user when focused, which also allows keyboard users to navigate the overflow
          more easily.

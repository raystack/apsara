Apsara is a pre-styled component library that is designed to work out of the box with minimal configuration.

## Installation

Getting up and running is quick and easy.

### 1. Install Apsara

Install Apsara from your command line.

```package-install
@raystack/apsara
```

### 2. Import the CSS file

Import the global CSS file at the root of your application.

```ts
import "@raystack/apsara/style.css";
```

#### Using normalize.css

Apsara includes an optional `normalize.css` stylesheet to help ensure consistency across different browsers. Unlike a CSS reset, `normalize.css` preserves useful default styles while correcting inconsistencies in how browsers render HTML elements.

If you'd like to enable it, simply import the provided stylesheet in your project:

```ts
import "@raystack/apsara/normalize.css";
```

### 3. Start building

You are now ready to use Apsara components.

```jsx
import { Button } from "@raystack/apsara";

<Button variant="solid" color="accent">
  Click here!
</Button>;
```

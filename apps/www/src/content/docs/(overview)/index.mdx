description: A design system for building accessible and composable user interfaces in React.
---

Apsara is an open-source React component library that provides enterprise-grade, accessible components for building complex data interfaces. Built on [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) primitives and [Base UI](https://base-ui.com/), it combines unstyled accessibility foundations with a carefully designed visual layer powered by CSS custom properties.

## Why Apsara?

**Accessibility first** — Every component is built on battle-tested primitives that handle ARIA attributes, focus management, and keyboard navigation correctly. You get accessible UI without the effort.

**Consistent design language** — A unified token system ensures visual consistency across your application. Colors, spacing, typography, and effects all follow predictable patterns that adapt automatically to light and dark modes.

**Production ready** — Components are designed for real-world applications: data tables with sorting and filtering, command palettes, multi-select comboboxes, and complex form controls that handle edge cases gracefully.

**Minimal footprint** — No runtime CSS-in-JS. Styles are vanilla CSS with semantic tokens, keeping your bundle lean and your performance predictable.

## Components

Apsara provides over 50 components organized by function:

| Category | Components |
|----------|------------|
| **Layout** | Box, Flex, Grid, Container, Separator |
| **Navigation** | Navbar, Sidebar, Breadcrumb, Tabs, Link |
| **Data Display** | DataTable, Table, List, Avatar, Badge, Chip, Indicator |
| **Forms** | Button, InputField, TextArea, Select, Combobox, Checkbox, Radio, Switch, Slider, ColorPicker, Calendar |
| **Feedback** | Dialog, Sheet, Popover, Tooltip, Toast, Callout, EmptyState, Skeleton, Spinner |
| **Utilities** | Command, Search, CopyButton, CodeBlock, ScrollArea |

## Theming

The theming system uses CSS custom properties (tokens) that automatically adapt to the active theme. Wrap your app with `ThemeProvider` to enable light/dark modes, accent colors, and style variants.

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "@raystack/apsara";

<ThemeProvider defaultTheme="system" accentColor="indigo">
  <App />
</ThemeProvider>
```

Tokens follow a consistent naming convention:

```css
.custom-element {
  color: var(--rs-color-foreground-base-primary);
  background: var(--rs-color-background-base-secondary);
  padding: var(--rs-space-4);
  border-radius: var(--rs-radius-3);
}
```

See the [Theme Overview](/theme/overview) for complete documentation.

## Technology

Apsara is built with:

- **[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)** — Unstyled, accessible component primitives
- **[Base UI](https://base-ui.com/)** — Headless UI components from MUI
- **[TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table)** — Powerful data table utilities
- **[class-variance-authority](https://cva.style/)** — Type-safe component variants
- **TypeScript** — Full type definitions for all components and props

FilterChip supports custom filter operations through the `operations` prop. When specified, these operations override the default operations that are automatically selected based on the `columnType`.

- When multiple operations are provided, they are rendered as a select dropdown
- When a single operation is provided, it is displayed as static text
- If no operations are specified, default operations are used based on the column type

<Demo data={operationsDemo} />

## Accessibility

- Uses `button` role with appropriate ARIA attributes
- Supports keyboard activation and removal
- Active filter state is communicated via `aria-pressed`

import { playground, stateDemo, sizeDemo } from "./demo.ts";

<Demo data={playground} />

## Anatomy

Import and assemble the component:

```tsx
import { IconButton } from "@raystack/apsara";

<IconButton />
```

## API Reference

<auto-type-table path="./props.ts" name="IconButtonProps" />

## Examples

## Size

The IconButton component offers different size options. You can customize the size using the `size` prop. The available size options are:

<Demo data={sizeDemo} />

### State

The IconButton component has different states: default, hover, and disabled.

<Demo data={stateDemo} />

## Styling

The IconButton uses CSS variables for consistent styling across themes:

- Background color uses `--rs-color-background-base-primary`
- Border color uses `--rs-color-border-base-primary`
- Text color uses `--rs-color-foreground-base-primary`
- Hover state uses `--rs-color-background-base-primary-hover`
- Disabled state uses reduced opacity and different background/border colors

## Accessibility

The IconButton component inherits all the accessibility features of the native HTML button element:

- Keyboard navigation support
- Proper disabled state handling
- Can be focused and activated using keyboard
- Supports all standard button ARIA attributes

For better accessibility, make sure to:

- Provide meaningful aria-label when the button's purpose isn't clear from the icon alone
- Consider adding tooltips for icon-only buttons

import { playground, sizeDemo, clearDemo } from "./demo.ts";

<Demo data={playground} />

## Usage

The Search component provides a consistent search input experience with a built-in search icon and optional clear button functionality.

```tsx
import { Search } from "@raystack/apsara";

<Search
  placeholder="Search items..."
  showClearButton
  value={searchValue}
  onChange={e => setSearchValue(e.target.value)}
  onClear={() => setSearchValue("")}
/>;
```

## Search Props

<auto-type-table path="./props.ts" name="SearchProps" />

## Examples

### Size

The Search component comes in two sizes to fit different design contexts.

<Demo data={sizeDemo} />

### Clear Button

The Search component can include a clear button that appears when there is input value.

<Demo data={clearDemo} />

## Accessibility

The Search component is built with accessibility in mind, following ARIA best practices:

- Container has `role="search"` to identify it as a search landmark
- Input has `type="search"` for semantic HTML
- Search icon is marked as decorative with `aria-hidden="true"`
- Clear button has appropriate `aria-label` for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support for the clear button
- Input inherits `aria-label` from placeholder text

Example with accessibility features:

```tsx
<Search
  placeholder="Search items..."
  showClearButton
  value="Searchable text"
  aria-label="Search items"
/>
```

The component supports keyboard navigation:

- Tab to focus on the search input
- Tab again to focus on the clear button (when visible)
- Enter or Space to trigger the clear button

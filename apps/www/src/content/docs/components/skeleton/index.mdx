## Usage

The Skeleton component is used to create placeholder loading states that represent the layout of content while it's being loaded. It provides a visual indication that content is loading and helps maintain layout stability.

```tsx
import { Skeleton } from "@raystack/apsara/v1";

<Skeleton width={200} height={20} />;
```

## Skeleton Props

<auto-type-table path="./props.ts" name="SkeletonProps" />

## Examples

### Basic Usage

A simple skeleton loader with fixed dimensions.

<Demo data={basicDemo} />

### Multiple Lines

Create multiple skeleton lines using the count prop.

<Demo data={multipleDemo} />

### Custom Styles

Customize the appearance using baseColor and highlightColor.

<Demo data={customStylesDemo} />

### Animation Control

Control the animation duration or disable it entirely.

<Demo data={animationDemo} />

### Complex Layout

Create a card-like loading state by combining multiple skeletons.

<Demo data={cardDemo} />

## Accessibility

The Skeleton component follows accessibility best practices:

- Uses semantic HTML elements
- Provides appropriate ARIA attributes
- Maintains sufficient color contrast
- Animation can be disabled for users who prefer reduced motion

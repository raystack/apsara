## Accessibility

The Switch component follows WAI-ARIA guidelines for toggle buttons:

- Uses proper ARIA attributes (`aria-checked`, `aria-required`, `aria-label`)
- Supports keyboard navigation (Space and Enter to toggle)
- Includes proper labeling and description support
- Changes cursor to 'not-allowed' when disabled
- Associates labels with the switch using htmlFor

## Overview

The `ColorPicker` component offers a flexible and composable solution for selecting colors in various formats, including HEX, RGB, and HSL. It supports optional alpha channel (transparency) and is designed for easy integration and customization within your application.

## Getting Started

To use the `ColorPicker`, import it from `@raystack/apsara` and compose its subcomponents as needed. Below is a basic example:

```tsx
import { ColorPicker } from "@raystack/apsara";

<ColorPicker
  defaultValue="#DA2929"
  style={{
    width: '240px',
    height: '320px',
    padding: 20,
    background: 'white'
  }}
>
  <ColorPicker.Area />
  <ColorPicker.Hue />
  <ColorPicker.Alpha />
  <Flex direction="row" gap={2}>
    <ColorPicker.Mode />
    <ColorPicker.Input />
  </Flex>
</ColorPicker>
```

## ColorPicker Props

The `ColorPicker` is composed of several subcomponents, each responsible for a specific aspect of color selection. The root component acts as a data provider for its children.

<auto-type-table path="./props.ts" name="ColorPickerProps" />

### ColorPicker.Area

Enables users to select a color from a palette. Typically used for choosing saturation and brightness.

### ColorPicker.Hue

Provides a slider for selecting the hue value of the color.

### ColorPicker.Alpha

Provides a slider for selecting the alpha value of the color.

### ColorPicker.Mode

Lets users switch between different color models (e.g., HEX, RGB, HSL) via a dropdown menu.

<auto-type-table path="./props.ts" name="ColorPickerModeProps" />

### ColorPicker.Input

Displays the current color value in the selected color model and allows direct text input.

## Usage

The FilterChip component provides a compact way to filter data with support for different input types like select, date, string and number.

```tsx
import { FilterChip } from "@raystack/apsara";

<FilterChip
  label="Status"
  leadingIcon={<InfoCircledIcon />}
  columnType="select"
  options={[
    { label: "Active", value: "active" },
    { label: "Inactive", value: "inactive" },
  ]}
  onValueChange={value => console.log(value)}
/>;
```

## FilterChip Props

<auto-type-table path="./props.ts" name="FilterChipProps" />

## Examples

### Input Types

FilterChip supports four different input types to handle various filtering needs.

<Demo data={inputDemo} />

### With Leading Icon

FilterChip can display an icon before the label to provide visual context.

<Demo data={iconDemo} />

### With Remove Action

FilterChip can include a remove action to allow users to dismiss the filter.

<Demo data={actionDemo} />

### Custom Operations

FilterChip supports custom operations to allow users to filter data with custom operations.
By default, FilterChip provides sensible operations based on the column type.

If a single operation is provided, it will be displayed as a text instead of a select.

<Demo data={operationsDemo} />

import { playground, inputDemo, iconDemo, actionDemo, operationsDemo } from "./demo.ts";

<Demo data={playground} />

## Usage

The FilterChip component provides a compact way to filter data with support for different input types like select, date, string and number.

```tsx
import { FilterChip } from "@raystack/apsara";

<FilterChip
  label="Status"
  leadingIcon={<InfoCircledIcon />}
  columnType="select"
  options={[
    { label: "Active", value: "active" },
    { label: "Inactive", value: "inactive" },
  ]}
  onValueChange={value => console.log(value)}
/>;
```

## FilterChip Props

<auto-type-table path="./props.ts" name="FilterChipProps" />

## Examples

### Input Types

FilterChip supports four different input types to handle various filtering needs.

<Demo data={inputDemo} />

### With Leading Icon

FilterChip can display an icon before the label to provide visual context.

<Demo data={iconDemo} />

### With Remove Action

FilterChip can include a remove action to allow users to dismiss the filter.

<Demo data={actionDemo} />

### Custom Operations

FilterChip supports custom filter operations through the `operations` prop. When specified, these operations override the default operations that are automatically selected based on the `columnType`.

- When multiple operations are provided, they are rendered as a select dropdown
- When a single operation is provided, it is displayed as static text
- If no operations are specified, default operations are used based on the column type

<Demo data={operationsDemo} />

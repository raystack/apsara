```

## FilterChip Props

## Examples

### Input Types

FilterChip supports four different input types to handle various filtering needs.

<Demo data={inputDemo} />

### With Leading Icon

FilterChip can display an icon before the label to provide visual context.

<Demo data={iconDemo} />

### With Remove Action

FilterChip can include a remove action to allow users to dismiss the filter.

### Custom Operations

FilterChip supports custom filter operations through the `operations` prop. When specified, these operations override the default operations that are automatically selected based on the `columnType`.

- When multiple operations are provided, they are rendered as a select dropdown
- When a single operation is provided, it is displayed as static text
- If no operations are specified, default operations are used based on the column type

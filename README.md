Apsara 🧚‍♀️ is an open-source re-usable UI components build using Radix UI and Stitches CSS-in-JS to power the projects for Open Data Platform.
Open Data Platform has a large number of enterprise-level products. With complex scenarios, designers and developers often need to respond fast due to frequent changes in product demands and concurrent R & D workflow. Many similar contents exist in the process. Through abstraction, we could obtain some stable and highly reusable components and pages on top of Radix UI.
